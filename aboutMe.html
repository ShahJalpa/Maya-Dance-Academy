                <h2>Jalpa Shah</h2>
                <h3>(Bharatanatyam dancer, choreographer and teacher.)</h3>
                <p>
                    Indian classical dance means something more than any other form of dance to me. This dance 
                    form is an art that in general refers to movement of body, typically rhythmic and to music 
                    which is used as a form of expression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My dance foundation began at kalakshetra at age of eight. After quite a lot of initial years
                    of obedience training with 
                    <a href="http://bharatnatyamdance.com/guru-kubernath-appaswamy-tanjorkar.php#GURUSHRI KUBERNATH APPASWAMY TANJORKAR">
                    Guru Shree Kubernath Tanjorkar</a> and <a href="http://www.shivkrupabharatnatyam.com/faculty.html#faculty">
                    Guru Shree Shivkumar Pillai</a>, I learnt complete form of Bharatantayam from “Tanjore Quartret”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My energetic and artistic form of dance style defined in very well manner by my gurus. As I 
                    strongly believe in classical form of dance to express my inner creativity, I try hard to 
                    encourage my student to enjoy of self – expression through the medium of Bharatanatyam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I try to put very hard efforts in my dance to dedicate to the pure art form. With this pure 
                    dance, I make an effort to carry a prosperous combination of classicism, power and artistic 
                    grace to my composition and teaching style.
                </p>  
                <p>
                    I am very thankful to my Gurus for giving me a disciplined training in the language and 
                    expressiveness of Bharatanatyam through which I can create and share my poems in motion.

          <h3>(Prayer to teacher)</h3>
            <p>
                &#34Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu
                <br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                Guru Devo Maheshwara
                <br>
                Guru Sakshat Parabrahma
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Tsmai Shri Guruve Namaha&#34
            </p>
            <h4>Meaning</h4>
            <p>
                The teacher is like Lord Brahma as he Generates the knowledge within us,
                <br>
                like Lord Vishnu as he Operates the ideas/knowledge in our mind unto the right path,
                <br>
                and like Lord Mahesha (Shiva) as he Destroys the wrong concepts attached to our 
                knowledge, while enlightening us on the desired path.
                <br>
                Thus the teacher is like our ultimate God and we should pray and give respect to our teacher.
